# Overview

This master thesis (MT) is conducted in the last semester of my Master program at FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg. This MT is a collaboration work between **FAU** and **Siemens**. During this project, I have the opporunity to implement my theoretical knowledge into real-world applications, in this case the engieering domain. The MT focuses on the realm of generative AI utilizing LLM and a Graph Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (GVQVAE) architecture. 

## Research

The MT focuses on an unexplored problem in the engineering domain, where there are no methods up to the date of the thesis is written, which focus on generating Sequential Function Charts (SFC) with additional context. SFCs can be considered like codes for PLC programming, which is mainly used in the automation domain. 

## Objectives

Firstly, the MT aims to **automate the generation of SFC using AI** to reduce manual efforts in the development proces. Besides, it aims to develop a **synthetic SFC dataset** tailored for the usage of generative models. Lastly, it focuses to **develop methods to generate SFC conditioned on textual user intents and existing sequences**.

## Skills acquired

1. Generative AI: LLM, Graph Machine Learning, PyTorch
2. Research
3. Statistics: Experimentation, Hypothesis Testing
